# AMDC-Firmware

Advanced Motor Drive Controller (AMDC), is an open-source project from the [Severson Research Group](https://severson.wempec.wisc.edu/) at [UW-Madison](http://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/), affiliated with [Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC)](https://wempec.wisc.edu/).

AMDC design includes both hardware and firmware. This repository contains the low-level firmware which runs AMDC, as well as example applications.

## Documentation

Documentation has been written to help ease the process of using the AMDC platform.

### Getting Started

Following these instructions will get the AMDC firmware environment up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

[Setting Up Development Environment](docs/Setting-Up-Development-Environment.md)

### Debugging

Problem with your firmware that you can't figure out?

[Debugging](docs/Debugging.md)

### Flashing AMDC

After development, the resulting firmware should be flashed to the AMDC so that the application will start immediately after power-up. Follow these instructions.
